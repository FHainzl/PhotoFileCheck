This code checkes wether for every file of a specified in a new directory, there is already a copy of it
in another directory or its subdirectories with the same name and the same creation date.

As a photographer, I wrote this program to check
if I transferred every photo from my SD card to my computer.

The program uses the pathlib, included in Python 3.4 or higher.
